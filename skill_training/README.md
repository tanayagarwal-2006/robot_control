Tried to implement a skill training mode where once the users wants to train the robot on a skill, the torque turns off so that the robot can be manipulated by hand to various positions, which can then be saved, before the skill is executed through a command of the user

Could not test this because of problems reading and toggling the torque of the base servo.
